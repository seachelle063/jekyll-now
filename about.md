Hey, welcome to this website!  Just another female in her late twenties juggling career, marriage, fur-children, and fitness. I hope you become inspired by what you see throughout this web page. My original thought for this project was to chronicle my attempts at trying to follow different recipes that i pinned on pinterest. Most of the recipes featured on this website will be with "clean eating" in mind. Meaning, all that fake preservative shit? No thanks. Granted, I am not a Sith so I guarantee there will be SOME exceptions, probably with some holiday recipes. Just forewarning you.

How did I get here? Let's back track to mid 2015. I was under significant occupational stress. I was on hypertension meds as well as an anti-depressant.  I had a BMI >25 (which pretty much means overweight). While I had been doing Crossfit 2-3 times per week since early 2014, I had recently bought a house and moved in NoVA and was between gyms. I was also running some (again, nothing consistent). Well, more like jogging. More like winded attempts at jogging.

My eating habits were bad. Like, REAL bad. Chinese take-out at least once per week, eating fancy breads and cheeses bought from Whole Foods all weekend, significant craft beer/wine intake, and eating out for breakfast/lunch many days of the week are just a few examples I can think of. Weekends were all about breweries, wineries, and eating out at restaurants (its what happens when you live only a mile from Washington, DC!!!)  During college and grad school, I definitely packed on the pounds from working at a retail coffee shop (pastries galore!). Bottom line: no amount of exercise I did could mitigate the damage I was doing from my diet. 

I'm not sure of when and how I had my moment of clarity, but I did research. I educated myself on what my body mass index (BMI) is, and why its a better measure than just your weight. I learned how to calculate the amount of calories I should be eating in order to lose weight. I purchased a kitchen scale and meticulously tracked what I put in my mouth. At first, if I could not log it, I didn't eat it. That meant no random slices of cake at work hails/farewells, no dining out at restaurants, little to no alcohol. I learned the art of organization and planning of meal preparation. I had to learn the difference between being hungry and having cravings, and I realized that food is FUEL, not something that always has to be satisfying and rich (read: cheesy, sugary and carby). I reaffirmed my commitment to Crossfit, and started working out at least three times per week.

Folks, the equation is simple. Burn more energy than what you consume. Creating a caloric deficit = you WILL LOSE WEIGHT. AND MOST OF THAT WEIGHT WILL BE FAT. By the end of 2015/beginning of 2016, I had weaned myself off of my anti-depressant (I would not recommend that, by the way). My blood pressure stabilized and with my primary care provider's blessing, I stopped those pills too. My BMI dipped to the low range of the 20's, which means normal for my height and weight. I was working out 3-5 times per week. And I felt good.  My husband started eating the same way and working out more, and he dropped BMI points as well. We were literally vanishing before people's eyes.

For the past year or two, I have been posting on my Instagram about my culinary re-creations, and more recently on my SnapChat. In many of the recipes posted on this site, I focus on the macro-nutritional content  as it is available. Read this to gain an understanding of why you should keep track of these.  "Meeting your Macro" goals is an important part of getting leaner and stronger. Current 2016 goals: Crossfit 4-5 times per week, and eat to gain muscle mass/get stronger.

And then I had this idea in mid- 2016: why don't I create a blog that combined my passions of Crossfit, cooking, and lifestyle? Then I had a better idea. I don't want to just get a template and have this be another Tumbler or Wordpress blog. BOR-ING. I am actually going to learn code and build my website (with the help of my software developer/computer science nerd husband). 

And voila. Cocinando RX'ed was born.
