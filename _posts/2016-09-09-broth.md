Back when I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, I had to really watch my sodium intake. I am still mindful of it now, but no where near like back then. I would store low-sodium salt in my pantry, avoid high salt foods like ramen, and choose items with "low sodium" on the front. Take chicken stock, for example. Or chicken broth. There's no difference, right?
For the purposes of this post, there's no difference. From here on out I will refer to it as "broth"

I don't remember when i exactly started making my own, but I knew that I was a. tired of the preservative-laden choices I was compelled to use and b. I was tired of half-empty boxes expiring in my fridge! What a waste...

My first attempts at making broth came after an extensive google search. Basically, save the chicken bones i used from making chicken dishes, boil them in water with some veggies and [a bouquet garni](http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/glossary/g/bouquetgarni.htm) for a couple of hours, and it should be good, right?
Ive probably been wronger before, but this was a big fat NOPE.

Enter chicken feet. You've seen packages of them in the grocery store, thinking, who in the hell uses those? (or maybe that's just me). I could never imagine using chicken feet in anything. My recent research told me that chicken feet and other jointed bones have nutrients, including collagen. Here is a good post about [the health benefits of bone broth](http://realfoodrn.com/the-health-benefits-of-bone-broth/) . Apparently, use of chicken feet (as well as simmering the broth around 24 hours as opposed to, like, four) is what makes the broth gelatinous and nutrient-dense. Before chicken feet, my broth was never like jelly, and didn't taste quite so rich. Fail.

I will admit to being grossed out by handling the one pound or so of feet. First l boiled  them for around five minutes (i assume for cleanliness purposes). Then, I hacked off the tips of each claw to get rid of the nails. This was the most labor-intensive part.

After my pound or so of declawed feet, I also procured a pound or so of leftover frozen bones that I have saved over the past couple of weeks.

**RX'ed TIP #1** Basically, I make chicken thighs, chicken drumsticks, and/or a chicken roaster, and we save the bones and put them in a collective bag in the freezer. Easy day.

Now that i have my >2 pounds of chicken feet and bones, I put them in a stock pot (20qt is what I used, but 16 or 12qt could do nicely). I fill the pot with water until the bones are covered, and the water line is about an inch above the bones. Add about two tablespoons of white or apple cider vinegar, bring it to a boil, and simmer. All. Day. Need to leave the house? Turn the burner off. Come back, turn it back on. Its an all day thang. While its simmering, I used a spoon or a strainer and remove the foam that rises to the top. You'll want to do this every so often.

Toward the end, maybe like three hours before you are done, throw in your veggies. 

**Rx'ed TIP #2** Its okay not to put your veggies in immediately. I was worried that they would begin to re-absorb the nutrients if over-cooked. Next time, I plan on waiting until about three or four hours before simmering time is done before adding the veggies.

This is another thing I like about making my own broth -  you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Celery, leaks, onions, carrots, garlic, you name it. When I made this recipe most recently, I used 2-3 stalks of celery (halved), a yellow onion (halved), and a handful of baby carrots. I also made my bouquet garni our of herbs i had growing on my deck -  rosemary, pineapple sage, and oregano. Just throw it into some cheesecloth, add some peppercorns and a bay leaf, and tie it together with kitchen string. Toss it into the pot.

When it was done simmering, I separated the bones, feet, bouquet garni, and overcooked veggies from the liquid. I also strained it a few times with a mesh strainer, to catch the small gritty bits. I left the pot to cool, and it started to transform into a jelly-like substance. SUCCESS!!! All THE COLLAGEN!

Storage.
I like Nom Nom Paleo's idea of how to store bone broth, and you can [read it here](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/98290360103/how-to-store-bone-broth) . Genius!

What do you like to put in your bone broth? In a couple of weeks, I plan on making a beef bone broth version of this. My research indicated that you should simmer that for twice as long. I look forward to finding out!
