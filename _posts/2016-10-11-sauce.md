Today is Columbus Day; and while I wont ever quite agree with or understand why it is a federal holiday, you won't see me complaining about a day off. So how am I spending it? Errands (aka doing boring adulthood things).

The unfortunate thing about today is the realization of how fricking COLD it got all of a sudden. I mean, it barely reached 60 degrees today. For our region, I would expect maybe low 70's and mid 60's by the end of the month. Its waaay too cold out for just a short sleeve shirt, a lesson I learned IRL.

Alas, the day was not of waste! I decided to make a batch of my homemade tomato sauce. Back story: ever since we got married, my husband would ALWAYS hate on me for using the typical jar of tomato sauce (think Prego, Ragu, etc). He would boast how his mother made a homemade sauce and that it always tasted fresh. In the back of my mind, I'm thinking, that's wonderful to have time to make your own sauce. Good for you. Me, I had school, i had LIFE.

Until I realized that it really wasnt that difficult or time consuming to make your own sauce. After some research, I came up with a recipe that models after a recipe The Pioneer Woman (one of my inspirations) featured, and something I saw on Buzzfeed. And its not so bad.

You will need the following:
*1 whole Yellow Onion, Diced

*1 roasted garlic clove (400 degrees for 40 min, s&p&evoo)

*1 whole (28-ounce) Can Whole Tomatoes

*1 whole (28 Oz. Size) Crushed Tomatoes

*1/2 BOTTLE RED WINE

*4-5 mushrooms, chopped

*1/4 teaspoon Salt

*1 teaspoon Sugar

*Freshly Ground Black Pepper

*1/4 cup Flat-leaf Parsley, Minced

*8 whole Fresh Basil Leaves (optional)

First, add the onions and the roasted garlic clove into a pot and cook for a few minutes with about I tbsp of ghee, or until translucent and add a bit of sugar. Pour in wine and chopped mushrooms, and let reduce. Pour in whole tomatoes, crushed tomatoes.  Add salt, pepper, sugar, and parsley. Stir to combine and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes.

Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, stirring very gently a couple of times during the simmer. I like my sauce to be smooth. so I like to use my hand blender to blend those whole tomato bits that haven't cooked down yet. If you dont have a hand blender, then you can always transfer the sauce into your regular blender or food processer once it is cool enough to handle.

See that velvety smooth texture?! #love

Just before serving, stir in basil if using. Or, you could put in chopped dried basil for flavor. I usually don't add the fresh basil because I am going to freeze this sauce for later use. Invest in some freezer-safe mason jars (it tells you on the packaging). Once the sauce is done, let it cool slightly and ladle into these mason jars. Once cool, pop on that lid and store in the freezer for future use!  Once you defrost it/use it in a future dish, THEN you can add that fresh basil!

What do you like to put in your sauce?
