Dang! I realize it’s been almost five months since I’ve written a blog post here! Don’t worry - I’m still alive, just have been going through some major, MAJOR, life changes. 

First off, I was re-hired at at a hospital in the public sector as a social worker in December of 2016. No more govt contracting for me! It was growing to be a caustic situation, with no room for growth. And I needed more stability in my employment--something that isn’t extended every year or two. Why now? Welp - around five months ago, I found out that I was pregnant. 

O_o say WUT

Actually, it didn’t come as a surprise, but I guess the quick timing of it did. I know that many of you who read this already know the trials and tribulations of pregnancy, but I want to be fair and forthcoming to many of you who are not familiar. So yes, I will be providing detail. So for the first three months (first trimester) I was focused on getting my current job and leaving where I was, while trying to keep quiet about my medical situation. I was exhausted after work and yes, I did have that dreaded morning sickness. Luckily, it never got that bad that I had to “toss my cookies.” I also found out that my cousin was pregnant with her first child as well, and we happened to be about two weeks apart! Although no one probably believes us, I SWEAR we did not plan that ish….

Fast forward until today, March of 2017. I am twenty five weeks pregnant (six months in) and have gained around 18 pounds; the heaviest I’ve ever been. I am slowly getting back into the groove of re-calculating my total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), and at least tracking what I am eating while pregnant. I haven’t stopped crossfitting; in fact, I’ve been making it in 2-3x per week. It has been rather difficult for me to accept my temporary physical limitations, but I am working on it. I can no longer do most ab exercises (except for planks), I’ve lost my pullups and my feeble attempts at double unders, and I definitely have lost strength in my squats and my lifts. Most of my gym tanks no longer fit, and I do get a bunch of comments about how big I am 
(I have a small frame). I have been tempted to push myself more; but I no longer can be selfish about what I want to do. Its definitely not about me anymore! To supplement, my husband and I have been building up our own home gym, so that I can do lifts/squats/crossfit WODS at home. Its been pretty nice, and my husband uses it a lot, too!

I’ve been posting a ton of my food pics on my insta (@seachellegrams); and I will be back to incorporating some recipes here! Promise! I take most pics with my iPhone 7, which does have an excellent camera, but we just ordered a mirrorless camera which will allow me to take professional-grade shots.I hope to get to posting once every other week or so, I think that is manageable! 

Are you a fellow #fitprego ? Holler back in the comments!
