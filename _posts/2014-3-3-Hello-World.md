To me, Chia seeds were this mysterious superfood to with magical powers to increase ones health. I mean, the resume looks awesome. [Read the benefits of ingesting chia seeds here.](https://authoritynutrition.com/11-proven-health-benefits-of-chia-seeds/) In the past, I've tried them once or twice by sprinkling on top of my salad-in-a-jar. Surprisingly, I didn't really feel too powerful after that, nor did they taste like anything. Meh. Fast forward two years later, and here I am back at it. After looking at the delectable-ness of [NomNomPaleo's](http://nomnompaleo.com/) chia seed pudding on both her Instagram story and her Snapchat, I decided to try working with chia seeds again. I felt a bit dismayed after reading that one serving (1 TBSP) is only 2g Protein, but I guess this stuff is more known for its fiber content.

Not trying to knock fiber or anything. Fiber's important too! It helps you go to the bathroom regularly. Can't be dominating at adulting if you're stopped up, can you?

According to [the brand I used](http://grocery.harristeeter.com/pd/Spectrum/Chia-Seed/12-oz/022506521063/), you can add it to yogurt, cereal, smoothies or salads. You can eat it whole or ground, raw or in baked goods. You can soak 'em in water to form a gel that can be flavored (which I guess is kinda what Chia Seed Pudding is all about). Apparently you can add some chia seeds to a water bottle to help keep the body hydrated during exercise (yea no. I like my water clear or with [BCAAS](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bcaas-the-many-benefits-of-amino-acids.html), not with mysterious black gelatinous specks up in it). 
 
As NomNomPaleo had not posted her Chia Pudding yet on her website,  I went ahead and found this recipe online featured by Joyful Healthy Eats. 

Serving size: ½ cup Calories: 110   F7/C10/P2

This recipe called for 
1 cup full fat coconut milk (I used Goya. I'm Puertorican. What else do you expect me to use?????)
¼ cup coconut water or regular water ( I used regular water)
2 tablespoons chia seeds
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
This recipe yielded 2-3 servings of result/product. I feel like I'm talking about a chemistry experiment. Anyways, it seemed very liquidy when I made it last night, around the 2100 hour. I wondered long is this damn thing supposed to take before it becomes this gelatinous pudding that is all the rage?!  As with many things, patience is a virtue. By the afternoon of the next day, it was the perfect consistency. It could even be a bit thicker IMO, which could be done by adjusting the liquid to seed ratio. So the longer you wait (preferably overnight or a bit longer), the better the yield.

Again, what I like about this is the natural sweetness of the coconut milk, the honey, and the vanilla extract. THIS WILL NOT TASTE LIKE ICE CREAM OR VANILLA PUDDING, you will be sadly disappointed if you go into this with those expectations! That being said, what i also like about this recipe is how you can customize it. In addition to adjusting the thickness by adjusting the liquid to seed ratio, you can add to the sweetness or texture by adding:

A different type of milk (almond, soy, rice), fruit, granola, cinnamon,cocoa powder, almond slivers, toasted coconut. Just to name a few off the top of my head. And of course, this goes without saying, but any addition or alteration would adjust the macros.
