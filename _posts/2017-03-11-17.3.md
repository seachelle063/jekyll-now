This morning was the third workout (out of five) for the 2017 Crossfit Open. [This](https://games.crossfit.com/workouts/open/2017) is what the workout consisted of.  Wearing a 20lb fat suit hasn’t made things easy, so I had to scale the majority of the workout. Basically, I had to scale the scale. For fellow pregos interested in what I did:

1. I did squat snatches for the 35# and 55# barbells (scaled division). For all other heavier snatches, I did a power snatch. Pregnancy makes you lose your balance by changing your center of gravity, and by screwing with your joints (making them looser, I think). Last time I did these I fell on my butt! (Husband wasn’t too happy to hear about that). I read somewhere that pregos should consider subbing a dumbbell snatch -- but nahhh. I was able to reach 75#.

2. Instead of the jumping pullups (scaled division), I did ring rows. All that jumping up and down---not happening here.

Overall, my score was a big fat Zero, since I could not meet the scaled division standard, but I still had a blast! Also, we invested in a mirrorless camera, and today was the first day I got to really test it out! I still have a lot to learn about taking good quality pictures, and lighting, and exposure, and all that artsy stuff. But out of my 3+ years of crossfitting, I can definitely say that people definitely WANT to get their picture taken of them doing hard things.
